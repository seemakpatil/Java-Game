# Java-Game

This is a game that I made where the user controls a penguin around the screen, collecting colored blocks as points. Each level, there are more blocks, and
getting the wrong colored block results in a point deduction. This game includes randomization of block placement, music, and a high score tracker so that
the user can try to beat their high score each time.
